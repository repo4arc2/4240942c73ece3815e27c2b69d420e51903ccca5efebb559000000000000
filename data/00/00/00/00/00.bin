Consider yourself
extremely fortunate, Mr. Walker,

and return the shield to us
with expedience.

You start by visiting Lemar's parents.

Contessa Valentina Allegra de Fontaine.

I know it's hard,
but I don't like to repeat myself,

176
00:14:31,333 --> 00:14:32,875
so you can just call me Val.

177
00:14:32,958 --> 00:14:36,750
But don't call me Val,
just keep it in your head.

Nobody in there is mad at you about that.

182

I mean, you would've been
doin' 'em a favor

00:14:49,708 --> 00:14:51,958
if you'd taken out the whole lot.

But these guys in ties, you know,
they got a whole thing to protect.

Excuse me. Who are you?

186
00:15:00,625 --> 00:15:04,833
Anyway, you did the right thing

187
00:15:04,917 --> 00:15:06,208
taking the serum.

188
00:15:06,292 --> 00:15:09,000
Yeah, of course I know about that.
And I'll tell you something.

189
00:15:09,083 --> 00:15:13,250
It has made you
very, very valuable to certain people.

190
00:15:13,333 --> 00:15:16,083
I actually think
it was the second best choice

191

you've ever made in your life.

what the first best choice was?

to the government.

202

It's kind of a legal gray area.

the famous 332 fight for this country,

You wanted to know what went wrong?

293
00:23:57,583 --> 00:24:03,167
A handful of us got shot up
with different versions of that serum,

294
00:24:03,250 --> 00:24:06,167
but they don't tell us what it is.

295
00:24:06,917 --> 00:24:10,042
They tell us it's tetanus.

296
00:24:10,125 --> 00:24:12,667
They sent us on missions,

297
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:16,000
even though the others weren't stable.

298
00:24:16,917 --> 00:24:20,042
Some of us started dying off.

299
00:24:20,125 --> 00:24:24,333
Then a couple of the boys
get captured on a mission.

300
00:24:25,708 --> 00:24:31,875
I heard the brass talkin'
about blowing the POW camp to hell

301
00:24:31,958 --> 00:24:33,083
to hide the evidence.

302
00:24:33,833 --> 00:24:37,167
But those were my men. My brothers.

303
00:24:37,250 --> 00:24:39,125
Not evidence.

304
00:24:40,333 --> 00:24:45,250
So I bust out of the facility one night

305
00:24:45,333 --> 00:24:47,417
and I brought them boys back.

306
00:24:48,042 --> 00:24:51,500
Not that it made a damn bit of difference.

307
00:24:52,750 --> 00:24:55,292
It wasn't long before it was only me left.

308
00:24:56,708 --> 00:24:59,333
And what did I get for saving their lives?

310

311

trying to figure out why the serum worked.

312
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:29,250
There was a nurse.

313
00:25:30,000 --> 00:25:31,583
She took pity on me.

314
00:25:31,667 --> 00:25:34,792
Wrote up some fake reports, something.

315
00:25:34,875 --> 00:25:37,708
She had me declared dead.

316

That's who gave me this.

You think things are different?
You think times are different?

325
00:26:26,042 --> 00:26:30,167
You think I wouldn't be dead in a day
if you brought me out?

326
00:26:31,833 --> 00:26:37,125
You wanna believe jail was my fault
because you got that white man's shield.

327
00:26:40,042 --> 00:26:43,000
They were worried my story might get out.

328
00:26:45,208 --> 00:26:48,917
So, they erased me.

329
00:26:50,125 --> 00:26:51,125
My history.

330
00:26:52,583 --> 00:26:55,083
But they've been doing that for 500 years.

Pledge allegiance to that, my brother.

333
00:27:03,917 --> 00:27:09,917
They will never let a Black man
be Captain America.

334
00:27:11,833 --> 00:27:12,958
And even if they did,

335
00:27:13,667 --> 00:27:19,333
no self-respecting Black man
would ever wanna be.

336

337
00:28:14,500 --> 00:28:15,792
SAM: Good job, guys.

338
00:28:16,833 --> 00:28:19,917
In about 10 years,
we'll have this thing fixed.

339
00:28:22,208 --> 00:28:25,208
Would be fun to take the boat out
one more time, before we sell it?

340
00:28:26,208 --> 00:28:27,958
There's a great spot in Grand Isle,

341
00:28:28,042 --> 00:28:30,625
your grandfather used to take me,
catch a lot of fish.

342
00:28:31,417 --> 00:28:32,917
But Mom said we can't sell it.

343
00:28:34,250 --> 00:28:35,375
SAM: What?

344
00:28:35,458 --> 00:28:36,667
It's too messed up.

345
00:28:37,292 --> 00:28:40,625
Mr. Dinh said he wouldn't buy it
'cause it cost more to fix.

346
00:28:41,625 --> 00:28:44,250
And then he said
something else in Vietnamese.

347

00:28:50,875 --> 00:28:52,583
I didn't wanna tell you last night

350
00:28:52,667 --> 00:28:55,292
when you were lookin' all sad puppy dog
in the rain.

351
00:28:56,375 --> 00:28:57,500
It was a rough day.

352
00:28:58,750 --> 00:29:00,208
You mean with Isaiah Bradley?

353
00:29:01,125 --> 00:29:02,417
And what they did to him.

354
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:06,000
You wanna talk about it?

355
00:29:06,667 --> 00:29:07,667
No.

356
00:29:08,458 --> 00:29:10,625
I'm trying to figure out
what it all means.

(SIGHS)

359
00:29:17,250 --> 00:29:21,625
But as far as the boat is concerned,
bottom line is, Mr. Dinh backed out.

360
00:29:22,917 --> 00:29:24,125
I don't know what to do.

361
00:29:24,208 --> 00:29:27,417
Parts alone on that thing are gonna eat up
most of what we get back.

362
00:29:27,500 --> 00:29:30,250
Listen to me. Don't worry.
I'm gonna fix the boat.

(CHUCKLES) Aren't you supposed to be off
saving the world?

364
00:29:32,958 --> 00:29:34,458
Why are you back here bothering me?

365
00:29:34,542 --> 00:29:37,542
'Cause my family's well-being
is a part of the world.

366
00:29:37,667 --> 00:29:40,833
(SMACKS LIPS)
So you're waiting for a lead?

367
00:29:40,917 --> 00:29:46,125
And the government stepped in
and took control and kind of benched us.

Nah. You weren't amending,
you were avenging.

You were stopping all the wrongdoers
you enabled as the Winter Soldier,

576

because you thought
it would bring you closure.

You go to these people and say "sorry,"

578

because you think
it'll make you feel better, right?

00:43:02,333 --> 00:43:04,167
But you gotta make them feel better.

00:48:41,750 --> 00:48:44,417
Sam screwed him out of a small fortune
not long ago.

645
00:48:44,500 --> 00:48:46,625
He's been dying to get payback ever since.

00:49:00,708 --> 00:49:02,958
So we're working with criminals now?

650
00:49:03,042 --> 00:49:04,042
Haven't you heard?

651
00:49:04,792 --> 00:49:05,792
We are criminals.

652
00:49:06,667 --> 00:49:08,833
Georges gets his payback
and we get a killer.

653
00:49:08,917 --> 00:49:10,375
It's a bargain on both sides.

654
00:49:11,792 --> 00:49:14,000
You invite me here for a picnic or what?

All of us.

679

Great work, Joaquin.

680
